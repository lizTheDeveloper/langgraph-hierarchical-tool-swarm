    "## Hierarchical Agent Teams\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous example ([Agent Supervisor](./agent_supervisor.ipynb)), we introduced the concept of a single supervisor node to route work between different worker nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the job for a single worker becomes too complex? What if the number of workers becomes too large?\n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, the system may be more effective if work is distributed _hierarchically_.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do this by composing different subgraphs and creating a top-level supervisor, along with mid-level supervisors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, let's build a simple research assistant! The graph will look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![diagram](./img/hierarchical-diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by the paper [AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155), by Wu, et. al. In the rest of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the agents' tools to access the web and write files\n",
    "2. Define some utilities to help create the graph and agents\n",
    "3. Create and define each team (web research + doc writing)\n",
    "4. Compose everything together.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before all of that, some setup:"

    "   Creating a specification for integrating Swaks (Swiss Army Knife for SMTP) with a Large Language Model (LLM) for testing and analyzing SMTP server functionality involves automating the process of sending test emails, capturing the output of these tests, and then processing this data for insights. Swaks is a versatile command-line tool that's ideal for this task, thanks to its ability to simulate various email sending scenarios and capture detailed SMTP session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification for Analyzing SMTP Functionality with Swaks and an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Develop an automated process to use Swaks for generating SMTP test emails, capturing the transaction details, and analyzing these details with an LLM to identify potential issues, optimizations, or confirm functionality of the SMTP setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Swaks Installation**:\n",
    "   - Ensure Swaks is installed on the system where the tests will be run. If not installed, Swaks can typically be installed via package managers on Unix-like systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SMTP Test Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Define SMTP server details, including the host, port, and any authentication details if necessary.\n",
    "   - Specify the sender and recipient email addresses for the test emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automated Swaks Execution**:\n",
    "   - Use Swaks to send test emails, capturing the detailed output of the SMTP transaction.\n",
    "   - Optionally, use various Swaks options to simulate different email sending scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structuring for LLM Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Process the Swaks output to extract and structure key data points from the SMTP transaction in a format suitable for LLM analysis, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **LLM Integration for Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Send the structured SMTP transaction data to the LLM for analysis.\n",
    "   - Interpret the LLM's output to extract actionable insights regarding SMTP server performance, configuration issues, or security concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Actionable Insights Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Based on the LLM's analysis, implement or suggest specific actions to address identified issues or optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "#!/bin/bash\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define SMTP server details\n",
    "SMTP_SERVER=\"smtp.example.com\"\n",

    "# Use Swaks to send a test email and capture the output\n",
    "swaks_output=$(swaks --server $SMTP_SERVER --port $SMTP_PORT --to $RECIPIENT --from $SENDER --hide-all)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process the Swaks output to extract relevant data and structure it for LLM analysis\n",
    "# This is a simplified example. You may need to adjust the parsing to fit your needs\n",
    "echo \"{ \\\"smtp_server\\\": \\\"$SMTP_SERVER\\\", \\\"smtp_port\\\": $SMTP_PORT, \\\"sender\\\": \\\"$SENDER\\\", \\\"recipient\\\": \\\"$RECIPIENT\\\", \\\"transaction_details\\\": \\\"$swaks_output\\\" }\" > $STRUCTURED_OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"Structured SMTP transaction data saved to $STRUCTURED_OUTPUT\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Placeholder for sending structured data to the LLM and retrieving analysis\n",
    "# You will need to implement this part based on how you interact with the LLM\n",
    "# Example placeholder:\n",
    "# python3 analyze_with_llm.py \"$STRUCTURED_OUTPUT\"\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"LLM analysis complete. Review recommendations and take action as necessary.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this script:\n",
    "- Ensure Swaks is installed on your system.\n",
    "- Replace placeholders (`smtp.example.com`, `sender@example.com`, `recipient@example.com`, `/path/to/swaks-output.json`) with actual values relevant to your test.\n",
    "- The processing of Swaks output in this example is very basic. Depending on your needs and the format of the LLM analysis, you may need to extract and structure the data more precisely.\n",
    "- Implement the logic for sending structured data to the LLM and processing its output according to the specifics of your LLM's API or interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification aims to facilitate automated testing and analysis of SMTP functionality using Swaks and an LLM, providing a basis for identifying and addressing issues within your SMTP server setup. \"\"\"\n",

    "   Creating a specification for integrating Swaks (Swiss Army Knife for SMTP) with a Large Language Model (LLM) for testing and analyzing SMTP server functionality involves automating the process of sending test emails, capturing the output of these tests, and then processing this data for insights. Swaks is a versatile command-line tool that's ideal for this task, thanks to its ability to simulate various email sending scenarios and capture detailed SMTP session data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specification for Analyzing SMTP Functionality with Swaks and an LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "Develop an automated process to use Swaks for generating SMTP test emails, capturing the transaction details, and analyzing these details with an LLM to identify potential issues, optimizations, or confirm functionality of the SMTP setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Swaks Installation**:\n",
    "   - Ensure Swaks is installed on the system where the tests will be run. If not installed, Swaks can typically be installed via package managers on Unix-like systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SMTP Test Configuration**:\n",
    "   - Define SMTP server details, including the host, port, and any authentication details if necessary.\n",
    "   - Specify the sender and recipient email addresses for the test emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automated Swaks Execution**:\n",
    "   - Use Swaks to send test emails, capturing the detailed output of the SMTP transaction.\n",
    "   - Optionally, use various Swaks options to simulate different email sending scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Structuring for LLM Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Process the Swaks output to extract and structure key data points from the SMTP transaction in a format suitable for LLM analysis, such as JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **LLM Integration for Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Send the structured SMTP transaction data to the LLM for analysis.\n",
    "   - Interpret the LLM's output to extract actionable insights regarding SMTP server performance, configuration issues, or security concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Actionable Insights Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Based on the LLM's analysis, implement or suggest specific actions to address identified issues or optimizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "\n",
    "echo \"Structured SMTP transaction data saved to $STRUCTURED_OUTPUT\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Placeholder for sending structured data to the LLM and retrieving analysis\n",
    "# You will need to implement this part based on how you interact with the LLM\n",
    "# Example placeholder:\n",
    "# python3 analyze_with_llm.py \"$STRUCTURED_OUTPUT\"\n",
    "\n",
    "echo \"LLM analysis complete. Review recommendations and take action as necessary.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this script:\n",
    "- Ensure Swaks is installed on your system.\n",
    "- Replace placeholders (`smtp.example.com`, `sender@example.com`, `recipient@example.com`, `/path/to/swaks-output.json`) with actual values relevant to your test.\n",
    "- The processing of Swaks output in this example is very basic. Depending on your needs and the format of the LLM analysis, you may need to extract and structure the data more precisely.\n",
    "- Implement the logic for sending structured data to the LLM and processing its output according to the specifics of your LLM's API or interface.\n",
    "\n",

They have distinctive features like a heterocercal caudal fin, bony scutes, and a largely cartilaginous skeleton. They are bottom-feeders, with a protrusible mouth that allows them to suck up their food. Sturgeons are known for their roe, which is processed into caviar - a highly prized and expensive product.\\n\\n## North American Species\\nIn North America, notable species of sturgeon include the Pallid Sturgeon (*Scaphirhynchus albus*), White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*), Green Sturgeon (*Acipenser medirostris*), and Shortnose Sturgeon (*Acipenser brevirostrum*). The White Sturgeon is the largest freshwater fish in North America, found from Mexico to Alaska, while the Shortnose Sturgeon is found along the eastern coast from New Brunswick to Florida. The Green Sturgeon also inhabits the west coast, from Mexico to Alaska.\\n\\n## Conservation Status\\nMany sturgeon species are threatened or endangered due to overfishing, poaching, habitat destruction, and dam construction. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists many sturgeon species as at risk, with some, like the Pallid Sturgeon, being critically endangered. \\n\\n## Regulatory Protections\\nAll sturgeons are protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This international agreement restricts the trade of sturgeon and sturgeon products to protect these ancient fish from overexploitation.\\n\\n## Selected North American Sturgeon Species and Conservation Status\\n\\n| Species                | Scientific Name             | Distribution (North America)          | Status                            |\\n|------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\\n| White Sturgeon         | *Acipenser transmontanus*   | West coast, from Mexico to Alaska     | Not endangered (some populations) |\\n| Shortnose Sturgeon     | *Acipenser brevirostrum*    | East coast, from New Brunswick to FL | Endangered                        |\\n| Green Sturgeon         | *Acipenser medirostris*     | West coast, from Mexico to Alaska     | Threatened                        |\\n| Pallid Sturgeon        | *Scaphirhynchus albus*      | Central U.S. river systems            | Critically Endangered             |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nThe North American sturgeons are remarkable survivors from a distant past, but they face significant challenges today. Conservation efforts and international trade regulations are crucial for the survival of these species. Continuous research, habitat protection, and careful management are essential to ensure that these ancient fish continue to thrive in modern times.\\n\\nPlease note that the status of species can change, and it is always important to consult the most current resources and regulatory documents for up-to-date information on species conservation status and legal protections.\\n\\n## References\\n- [Wikipedia - Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon)\\n- [Earthwave - Sturgeon](https://www.earthwave.org/sturgeon)\\n- [NOAA Fisheries - Green Sturgeon](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/green-sturgeon)\\n- [American Oceans - Types of Sturgeon](https://www.americanoceans.org/facts/types-of-sturgeon/)\\n- [Pond Informer - Sturgeon Species](https://pondinformer.com/sturgeon-species/)\\n\\n(Chart created based on the information gathered from the sources above)', name='Search')]}}\n",
